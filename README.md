## Feature Engineering
- Generated new dataframes derived from the original dataset.  
- Developed additional features by applying a variety of functions.

## Analysis and Visualization
Utilized visualizations to explore the factors influencing employee attrition, employing Seaborn and Matplotlib for effective data representation.

## Results
Overall, attrition is predominantly observed among younger age groups, particularly those aged 26 to 35, as well as among employees with high job satisfaction levels. Certain job roles, such as Lab Technicians and Sales Executives, also show higher turnover rates.

Additionally, male employees and those working in the R&D and Sales departments exhibit a greater tendency to leave, suggesting that these areas may face specific challenges.

Interestingly, despite higher educational qualifications and closer proximity to the workplace, attrition rates remain a concern. This indicates that other factors, such as the work environment and role-specific pressures, may significantly contribute to employee turnover.
